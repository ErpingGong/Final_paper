# The Faces of Domestic Violence: An
Intersectional Analysis of Felony Assaults and
Rapes in NYC∗
## Overview
This paper presents a statistical analysis of offense classification within the criminal justice system using a multinomial logistic regression model. The research
examines the influence of victim and suspect demographics—specifically race, sex,
age, and socioeconomic factors—on the categorization of incidents as either felony
assault, rape, or a reference category, designated ‘DIR’. Our methodological approach draws on a dataset that captures a broad spectrum of reported offenses,
allowing for an assessment of how these individual characteristics may bias offense
classification. The study aims to illuminate patterns that could suggest systemic
inequities, providing a basis for future policy discussions.
